### Getting Started
- All of the server information can be found in doc/architecture.md
- All of our database information is stored on Firebase. The YouTube player listens for changes in firebase and then it will load the next video in the queue.
- The server listens to changes on the YouTube player state. When a video ends, it will tell the server to load up the next video.
- The express server acts as the 'master user', and manages all of the Firebase changes. 
- Currently the app requires that you register and login before you can submit a chat message.
- The automatic deployment works off of the develop branch, not the master branch


### Known Bugs
- If you insert an invalid link, the server will crash and you will have to restart it. Our current regex filter checks to see if a link is a youtube url, but not if it's a valid one. 
- If the next video in queue is the same as the current video, it will not update
- Chatroom doesn't scroll to bottom as a default
